PHPFrame Scaffold installation instructions
-------------------------------------------

This installation instructions are temporary and only intended to be used by developers.

Requirements
------------

Before installing PHPFrame Scaffold please make sure that you have a working web server 
and that it meets the recommended minimum requirements: 

- MySQL 5.x or higher
- PHP 5.2.0 or higher
- PHP Extensions:
    - MySQL
    - Filter
    - GD
    - IMAP
- PHPFrame 1.0

You can check this by looking at the output of phpinfo() in a php script. Simply create 
a text file in your web server, add the following code and save it with a .php extension 
(ie: test.php, or info.php, ...):

<?php phpinfo(); ?>

Browse this script on your web browser and that will show full details of your PHP installation.


Command line installation
-------------------------

1. Download source from repository
    
    Use this command to anonymously export the latest source code to the directory where you 
    want to install PHPFrame Scaffold.
    
    For example, to deploy a scaffold for MyApp under /opt in a linux box:
    svn export http://phpframe.googlecode.com/svn/PHPFrame_Scaffold/trunk/ /opt/MyApp/
    
    * Developers with commit access remember to checkout using HTTPS and authentication to be 
    able to make changes. 


2. Create database and database user

    To do this you will need access to the mysql server with a user with privileges to create 
    new users, databases and grant privileges to other users. We will use the MySQL root user 
    in this example.

    mysql -u root -p
    mysql> CREATE USER 'myapp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ChangeMe' ; 
    mysql> GRANT USAGE ON * . * TO 'myapp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ChangeMe' ; 
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE `myapp` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci ; 
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `myapp` . * TO 'myapp'@'localhost' ;
    mysql> quit
    

3. Import database structure and initial data
    
    mysql -u root -p myapp < installation/install.sql
    
    
4. Filesystem settings

    Make sure the webserver has both read and write access to the var folder.

    Give web server user write access to public/uploads folder.
    
    Check overall filesystem permissions. Make sure the webserver has read access to the whole 
    site, but only write access on the directories mentioned above.


5. Create configuration file

    Rename or duplicate config.php-dist to config.php and fill in all parameters as described 
    in the document's comments. This document can be found under the "inc/" directory.
    
    cp inc/config.php-dist inc/config.php
    nano inc/config.php


6. Delete installation directory

    rm -rf installation

7. Log in to web interface and change the default admin details

    Now you should be able to browse the site with your web browser. If you installed it locally 
    in your web root you should be able to access your site at http://localhost.
    
    The install.sql script creates a default admin user that you will use the first time you log 
    in. The credentials for this user are:
    
    username: admin
    password: Passw0rd
    
If you have any questions or problems regarding the installation process please feel free to ask
