Extranet Office installation instructions
-----------------------------------------

This installation instructions are temporary and only intended to be used by developers.
A web installer will be included with released versions, but since we don't have it yet 
this basic guide should do for now.

Requirements
------------

Before installing Extranet Office please make sure that you have a working web server 
and that it meets the recommended minimum requirements: 

- MySQL 5.x or higher
- PHP 5.2.0 or higher
- PHP Extensions:
	- MySQL
	- Filter
	- GD
	- IMAP

You can check this by looking at the output of phpinfo() in a php script. Simply create 
a text file in your web server, add the following code and save it with a .php extension 
(ie: test.php, or info.php, ...):

<?php phpinfo(); ?>

Browse this script on your web browser and that will show full details of your PHP installation.


Command line installation
-------------------------

1. Download source from repository

	Browse to the directory where you want to install Extranet Office. This will have to be 
	inside the web root (ie: /var/www or /home/sites/mysite/public_html).
	
	Use this command to anonymously check out the latest project source code to the current 
	working directory:
	
	svn checkout http://extranetoffice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/ ./
	
	* Developers with commit access remember to checkout using HTTPS and authentication to be 
	able to make changes. 


2. Create database and database user

	To do this you will need access to the mysql server with a user with privileges to create 
	new users, databases and grant privileges to other users. We will use the MySQL root user 
	in this example.

	mysql -u root -p
	mysql> CREATE USER 'extranetoffice'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ChangeMe' ; 
	mysql> GRANT USAGE ON * . * TO 'extranetoffice'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ChangeMe' ; 
	mysql> CREATE DATABASE `extranetoffice` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci ; 
	mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `extranetoffice` . * TO 'extranetoffice'@'localhost' ;
	mysql> quit
	

3. Import database structure and initial data
	
	mysql -u root -p extranetoffice < installation/install.sql
	
	
4. Filesystem settings

	Create "filesystem" folder outside of web root, but make sure the webserver has both read 
	and write access.
	
	For example:
	mkdir /var/extranet_fs

	Give web server user write access to uploads folder. By default this is a directory named 
	"uploads".
	
	Check overall filesystem permissions. Make sure the webserver has read access to the whole 
	site, but only write access on the directories mentioned above.


5. Create configuration file

	Rename or duplicate config.php-dist to config.php and fill in all parameters as described 
	in the document's comments. This document can be found under the "inc/" directory.
	
	cp inc/config.php-dist inc/config.php
	nano inc/config.php


6. Delete installation directory

	rm -rf installation

7. Log in to web interface and change the default admin details

	Now you should be able to browse the site with your web browser. If you installed it locally 
	in your web root you should be able to access your site at http://localhost.
	
	The install.sql script creates a default admin user that you will use the first time you log 
	in. The credentials for this user are:
	
	username: admin
	password: Passw0rd
	
If you have any questions or problems regarding the installation process please feel free to ask 
in the developers discussion group at http://groups.google.com/group/extranetoffice-dev or 
directly via email at extranetoffice-dev@googlegroups.com.
